            As the front-end lead for the team in charge of the admin-facing sites, I created wireframes and protoypes of each step, contributed and in some cases led meetings about data-structure and interaction, and finally created the two web-apps through React.
            I worked with another company who was commissioned to help create the customer facing portion of the site to ensure consistency and interaction between every layer.`
